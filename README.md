# Task Conditional Neural Networks (TCNN)  via Honglin Li



Task Conditional Neural Networks (TCNN) leverage the probabilistic neural networks to estimate the probability density of the training samples. Then produce the task likelihood during the test state to fire the task-specific neurons correspondin to the test sampels. TCNN can detect and learn the new tasks fully-automatically without informing the changes to the model.
