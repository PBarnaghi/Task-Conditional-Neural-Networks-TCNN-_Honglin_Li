name: Continual learning by using task conditional neural networks
description: Task Conditional Neural Networks (TCNN) leverage the probabilistic neural
  networks to estimate the probability density of the training samples. Then produce
  the task likelihood during the test state to fire the task-specific neurons corresponding
  to the test samples. TCNN can detect and learn the new tasks fully-automatically
  without informing the changes to the model
